## Computational Social Choice and Crypto       
![ComSoc_wide](/img/ComSoc_06-2022_wide.jpg)

#DivingDeeper - Guest Lectures at TE Academy    
**Presented by TE Academy and [SCRF ‚Äì Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/new-to-the-forum-start-here/1162)**

Social choice deals with designing and analysing algorithmic and game-theoretic principles that are applicable for making community decisions that respect the preferences of the community members. This includes tasks as varied as **how to divide resources among agents, match agents to resources, and make joint decisions that are acceptable and beneficial to the community as a whole.** Such algorithms are crucial in crypto both for network-level operations such as selecting a validator committee and reaching a voting-based consensus and governance-level operations such as changing a protocol or deciding on how to use a DAO treasury.

This series of lectures will provide a general overview of the field and present some of its classical theoretical results.

**Our Guest: [Assistant Professor Nimrod Talmon, PhD](https://sites.google.com/view/zutot)**    
Ben-Gurion University, Israel

Nimrod Talmon is a tenured assistant professor in Ben-Gurion University and a consultant for technological companies in the crypto sector. His main research is in the intersection of computational social choice, combinatorial optimization, and decentralized governance in the context of decentralized autonomous organizations. He is regularly publishing in venues such as AAAI, IJCAI, and AAMAS, and serving in the program committee of these conferences. He has an Erd√∂s number 3, Sabbath number 7, and, arguably, Bacon number 6.

**What you can expect:**  
- Three sessions, 90 mins each
- Additional reading materials
- Meet and discuss with other aspiring Token Engineers
- Discuss and sharpen your understanding about:
    - COMSOC general overview
    - Preference aggregation and voting systems
    - The governance scalability problem

The Governauts Rewards Systems Research Initiative is a 3-months program to explore incentives in a DAO context.
Rewards Systems are a key element for DAOs to grow the ecosystem value, reward contributors, and grant decision-making power (governance tokens) to those who provide value to a DAO.

In this program, we'll explore different DAO cases, analyze data, design mechanism improvements and verify our assumptions with experiments in real-DAO environments.

Here's what you can expect:

- get an in-depth introduction to various DAO rewards systems in production, and discuss with DAO stakeholders
- learn to explore DAO data and verify our assumptions about DAO contributors
- meet other Governauts and collaborate on new token-based compensation mechanisms  
- learn how to model rewards systems and apply your cadCAD skills!

**This is a multidisciplinary program!**¬†We welcome co-researchers from many fields, like behavioral economics, (computational) psychology, sociology, game design, engineering, math, data analytics or computer science - and of course: DAOists!  

**Start:**¬†Tuesday, Nov 16, 2021  
**End:** Thursday, Feb 24, 2022  
**Duration:** 12 weeks  
**Skills:** Data Analysis, Python, Math & Statistics, cadCAD, and/or tokenSPICE most welcome, but not mandatory
