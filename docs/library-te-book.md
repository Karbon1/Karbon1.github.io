"[A Hitchhiker's Guide to Token Engineering](http://tokengenie.org/)â€œ is a crowdsourced and crowdfunded book and [online content repo](https://github.com/Freeelio/TE-Book) for token designers, entrepreneurs and applied researchers to get the hang of Token Engineering. The book aims at giving the full account of experience with an end-to-end tool chain: from co-designing the digital ecosystem through [games](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444), to mapping the territory, to not mistaking the map for the territory. It's full of cautious tales, as well as the soothing layout of a tool chain that will assist you in [designing](https://github.com/villeeloranta/ecosystem-design-toolkit), [modeling, simulating](https://cadcad.org/), [securely deploying](https://openzeppelin.com/), [governing](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2725415), and [upgrading](https://medium.com/block-science/computer-aided-governance-cag-a-revolution-in-automated-decision-support-systems-9faa009e57a2) a token economy - building on the multidisciplinary foundations of cryptoeconomics. This is going to be a hell of a ride. So, [grab your towel](https://github.com/Freeelio/TE-Book/wiki). 



Check out the Annotated Table of Content on GitHub: https://github.com/Freeelio/TE-Book/blob/master/Annotated-ToC.md Watch that repo for updates on ToC in the coming days until 20 June 2020, when Early Access starts. During Early Access June-August, when first drafts of chapters are being released, the repo will be filled with bounties and quests. This is when public contributions start. Of course you can already [join the Early Access](https://tokengenie.org/#Buy) when you have vested interest, i.e. you are currently tending to the design of a token economy, or part of a vivid network that could scale through tokenization. Especially, **"Chapter 3. Cryptoeconomics Patterns"** and **"Chapter 4. Token Model Generation"** might be of interest to you. Of course, the book applies itself to itself and will have a token model. You can follow along step-by-step and give feedback what works for you and what doesn't. Maybe you have better insights with different tools? Contribute! 

**NEWS: First learning module from "Chapter 4. Token Model Generation" made it to TE Academy as "Ecosystem Value Flows"! You can [apply until July 9](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome#ecosystem-value-flows) to participate in the first iteration**
