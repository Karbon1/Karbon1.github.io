## TEGG 

_Token Engineering Global Gathering._

Cryptoeconomic systems will redefine the way we understand business and economics in the 21st century. However, creating such tokenized ecosystems is hard.

The TEGG 2019 invites token engineers, cryptoeconomic researchers, developers and professionals in the sector to learn, share insights, discuss, and move this new discipline forward.
TEGG 2019 is organized by the Token Engineering global community.

Started only one year ago our community has quickly grown to 18 local meetup groups in 13 countries all across the globe.
